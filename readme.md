# Introduction to R and RStudio

In this course, you will obtain a introduction to R and RStudio and how it can be used for data analysis and statistics. This course is for people completely new to R, but those who have used R before but are still relatively new to it will hopefully find it useful too.

The course will cover these key topics:

* RStudio â€“ a tour of the most widely used interface to R and how to use it effectively
* Fundamentals of R and the R environment, including variables and assignment, data structures (such as vectors and data frames), operations on data structures, functions, scripts, installing and loading packages, using RStudio projects and reading in data
* Brief introduction to data wrangling using R; the art of cleaning and restructuring data (focusing on filtering, slicing, selecting, renaming, and mutating data frames)
* Brief introduction to data visualization, with an introduction to ggplot, scatterplots, boxplots and histograms
* An introduction to widely used statistical using R (linear regression, anova, and some other simple tests).

The course will take 5hr + 30 mins contact hours with two 2-hour breaks. The sessions will be as follows:

* Session 1: 9:30am-11:30am;
* Session 2: 12:30am-2:30pm;
* Session 3: 3:30pm-17:00pm
