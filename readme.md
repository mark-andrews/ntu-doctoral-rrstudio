# Introduction to R and RStudio

In this two-day course, you will obtain an introduction to R and RStudio and how it can be used for data analysis and statistics. The first day of the course is for people completely new to R, but those who have used R before but are still relatively new to it will hopefully find it useful too. The second day covers more advanced topics, including data wrangling, generalized linear models, and mixed effects models.

The first day will cover these key topics:

* RStudio â€“ a tour of the most widely used interface to R and how to use it effectively
* Fundamentals of R and the R environment, including variables and assignment, data structures (such as vectors and data frames), operations on data structures, functions, scripts, installing and loading packages, using RStudio projects and reading in data
* Brief introduction to data wrangling using R; the art of cleaning and restructuring data (focusing on filtering, slicing, selecting, renaming, and mutating data frames)
* Brief introduction to data visualization, with an introduction to ggplot, scatterplots, boxplots and histograms
* An introduction to widely used statistical using R (linear regression, anova, and some other simple tests).

The second day will cover:

* Data wrangling using the `dplyr` tools
* Generalized linear models like logistic regression, Poisson regression, negative binomial regression
* Multilevel or mixed effects models

On each day, the course will take 5hr + 30 mins contact hours with two 2-hour breaks. The sessions will be as follows:

* Session 1: 9:30am-11:30am;
* Session 2: 12:30am-2:30pm;
* Session 3: 3:30pm-17:00pm
